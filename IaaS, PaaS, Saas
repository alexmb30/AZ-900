# IaaS - PaaS - Saas

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - the most flexible service among the three. The cloud provider takes care of the hardware but operating system maintenance
and network configuration is the user's responsibilty. 

Provided: Datacenter, Networking Firewall/Security, Server and Storage.

Description:
CapEx: None. User has no up-front costs.
Agility: Applications can be made accessible easily. and deprovisioned when necessary
Management: Shared model of responsibility. Users maintains provisioned services and CSP manages and maintains the cloud infrastructure.
Consumption-based model: Users operate under and OpEx model and pay only for what they use.
Skills: No deep skills are required to deploy, use and gain benefit of a public cloud. Customers can rely on the CSP to ensure workloads are safe, secure and highly available.
Cloud Benefits: Organizations can rely on the CSP to ensure workloads are safe, secure and highly available.
Flexibility: the most flexible because you have the conttrol to configure and manage the hardware running your application.


## Platform as a Service (PaaS) - the cloud provider (CSP) provides the VM and networking and the user deploys their applications into the managed hosting environment
where developers can upload their applications without having to worry about the physical hardware and storage requirements. 

Provided: Datacenter, Networking Firewall/Security, Server and Data Storage, Operating Systems, Development tools, Database management, Data Analytics.

CapEx: none. No up-front costs.
Agility: more agile than IaaS and users don't need to configure servers for running applications
Consumption-based model: Users pay for what they use and operate under the OpEx model
Skills: no deep skills are required to deploy, use and gain benefit of a public cloud.
Cloud Benefits: Organizations can rely on the CSP to ensure workloads are safe, secure and highly available. Also, users can gain access to more cutting-edge app 
development tools. They can then apply those tools across the application's lifecycle.
Productivity. Users can focus on application development only, because the cloud provider handles all platform management.
Working with distributed teams as services is easier because the platform is accessed over the internet. You can make the platform available globally more easily.
Platform limitations. There can be some limitations to a cloud platform that might affect how an application runs. 
When you're evaluating which PaaS platform is best suited for a workload, be sure to consider any limitations in this area.

Software as a Service (SaaS) - the most cost-efficient service. CSP provides VMs, networking resources, storage and applications. The user only needs to provide data
example: Excel is available on the VM. The user can open it and upload his data to work with it. 

Provided: Datacenter, Networking Firewall/Security, Server and Data Storage, Operating Systems, Development tools, Database Management, Data ANalytics, Applications.
